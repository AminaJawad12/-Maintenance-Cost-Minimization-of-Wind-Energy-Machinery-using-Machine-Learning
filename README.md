# -Maintenance-Cost-Minimization-of-Wind-Energy-Machinery-using-Machine-Learning
This project applies machine learning to predictive maintenance of wind turbines. Using sensor data (V1â€“V40), a tuned XGBoost model was developed to predict failures, achieving 99% accuracy. The model significantly reduces maintenance costs by optimizing repair vs. replacement decisions.
